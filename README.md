# python-oop-assignment
A Python project exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Includes custom classes like Smartphones and Books, demonstrating constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
# 🧠 OOP Assignment – Python Classes

This project is part of a programming assignment that explores **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using Python. It includes custom-designed classes such as **Smartphones** and **Books**, and demonstrates the use of **constructors**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.

---

## 🚀 Project Features

### ✅ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
- Custom classes: `Smartphone`, `Book`
- Constructors to initialize object attributes
- Inheritance to extend base classes
- Method overriding for dynamic behavior

### 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Common method `action()` used by multiple classes
- Each class implements its own version of the method (e.g., `Smartphone`, `Book`, `AudioBook`)

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `smartphone_class.py` – Contains the `Smartphone` and `GamingPhone` classes
- `book_class.py` – Contains the `Book` and `AudioBook` classes
- `polymorphism_demo.py` – Demonstrates polymorphism using a shared method

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OOP Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Method Overriding, Polymorphism
